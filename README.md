# delivery_time_prediction

📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting delivery time for logistics or courier services using various features such as delivery location, restaurant rating, and vehicle conditions. The dataset is preprocessed, analyzed, and used to train machine learning models for accurate prediction.

📂 Dataset
The dataset likely includes columns such as:

Delivery_person_Age

Delivery_person_Ratings

Restaurant_latitude, Restaurant_longitude

Delivery_location_latitude, Delivery_location_longitude

Weather_conditions

Road_traffic_density

Vehicle_condition

multiple_deliveries

Time_Orderd, Time_Order_picked

Time_taken (min)

Note: Ensure missing values and incorrect types are cleaned before model training.

⚙️ Project Workflow:

Data Loading

Import necessary libraries and load the dataset (CSV or Excel).

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values.

Converting categorical variables to numerical (Label Encoding/OneHot).

Feature scaling using StandardScaler.

Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualizing trends using Seaborn/Matplotlib.

Understanding feature correlations.

Model Building

Train/test split.

Models used may include:

- Linear Regression

- Random Forest Regressor

- XGBoost Regressor

Model Evaluation

Performance metrics like:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

- R² Score

📈 Results:

Model performance is compared using evaluation metrics. The best-performing model is selected based on R² Score and error minimization.
